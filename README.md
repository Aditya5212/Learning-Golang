# My Go Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my personal repository for learning the Go programming language! This space is dedicated to tracking my progress, storing code examples, and documenting the concepts I explore as I dive deeper into Go.

## Purpose

The main goals for this repository are:
- To practice and solidify my understanding of Go's syntax, features, and paradigms.
- To keep a structured collection of code snippets and small projects.
- To serve as a personal reference for Go concepts I've covered.

## Structure

I'm organizing this repository by topics. You'll likely find directories corresponding to different areas of Go, such as:

- `Basics/`
- `DataStructures/`
- `Concurrency/`
- `Advanced-Go/`
  - `02Interfaces/` (This is where the example `main.go` you showed me likely lives, demonstrating Go's powerful interface system!)
- ...and more as I continue learning!

Each directory will typically contain `.go` files with examples related to its theme.

## How to Use

If you're looking to run any of the examples:

1.  **Ensure Go is installed:** If you haven't already, download and install Go from golang.org.
2.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd Learning-Golang
    ```
3.  **Navigate to an example:** For instance, to run the interfaces example:
    ```bash
    cd Advanced-Go/02Interfaces
    ```
4.  **Run the Go program:**
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

## Example Spotlight: Interfaces

Go's approach to interfaces is a key feature. As seen in `Advanced-Go/02Interfaces/main.go`, we can define behavior and have different types implement it implicitly.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type Shape interface {
	Area() float64
}

type Rectangle struct {
	length float64
	width  float64
}

func (r Rectangle) Area() float64 {
	return r.length * r.width
}

// ... (Circle struct and its Area method would also be here)
```
This allows for flexible and decoupled code, a common theme in Go development.

Happy Go-ding! ðŸ¤“
